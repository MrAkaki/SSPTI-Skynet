# Alliance Rules (GSF)

Primary rule: follow official alliance guidance, not "someone said".

## Standings / blues

Read and follow the consolidated Blue-Fucking Policy thread:
https://goonfleet.com/index.php/topic/332781-gsf-consolidated-blue-fucking-policy-thread-read-it-or-else/

## Fleet behavior

Fit what the FC pings.
Don’t bring experimental fits unless explicitly allowed.

Use Mumble as required.
Anchor when told, broadcast early, and don’t improvise in the middle of a strat-op.

## Comms and conduct

Keep local boring.
Don’t try to do diplomacy in local chat.
