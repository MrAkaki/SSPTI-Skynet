# Corporation Rules (Discord Server)

Due to recurring issues, these are the basic communication rules for the server.
Same rules apply to voice chats.

Any derogatory language towards any member is prohibited.

## No spamming

Don’t send lots of small messages right after each other.
Do not disrupt chat by spamming.

## No advertisements

No advertising other communities or streams.
You may post your content in the media channel only if it is relevant and provides actual value (video/art).

## No offensive names or profile pictures

You will be asked to change your name or picture if staff deems them inappropriate.

## No server raiding

Raiding or mentions of raiding are not allowed.

## Enforcement and disputes

Directors and Mods may mute/kick/ban at their discretion.

Most channels have pinned messages explaining what they’re for and how things work.
If you don’t understand something, ask.
