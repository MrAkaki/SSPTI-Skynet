## Important requirements (read this)

Full authentication is mandatory.
Every single character you own must be on BOTH the corporation auth and the alliance auth.

Jabber must be set up and running while you play.
If you have problems: follow the Jabber setup guide.
If it still doesn’t work: DM any @Recruiting Officer.

Mumble must be set up and used for fleets.
If you have problems: follow the Mumble setup guide.
If it still doesn’t work: DM any @Recruiting Officer.

## Activity requirement (PAPs)

Do at least 3 strategic PAPs per month.
Aim to get into the main DPS ships whenever possible.

This is player-based, not character-based.
Having 10 characters does not reduce the requirement.

Check your PAPs here:

If we hit the top of the alliance PAP standings, we try to drop corp tax as much as possible for a few days.
